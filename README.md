I'm Isaac. I write code with Javascript, C++, Ruby, and sometimes Python.

Currently involved in the competitive programming scene, and participating in contests where I am able.

- 🧍 About me
  
  I love programming, I study algorithms every day, and I can talk your ear off about data structures.
  
  As for other hobbies, I'm a lead singer in a metal band. I also (pseudonymously) write horror novels... okay, well, just one novel so far, but I'm proud of it! There are some [excerpts](https://github.com/IsaacBell/j-78) scattered [around](https://github.com/IsaacBell/crystal-dreams) on my Github profile.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ...
  
  1. Completing the CSES algorithm problem set
  2. Ranking up on the Codeforces platform
  3. Replacing coffee with tea as my drink of choice

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
  
  Combinatorics. A major weak area of mine.
  
  Next up is expected value and probability, which I believe is my weakest area in both math and CS contexts.
