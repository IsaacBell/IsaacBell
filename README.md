I'm Isaac. I write code with Javascript, C++, and Ruby. 

Sometimes, if I'm feeling frisky, I'll play around with [C#](https://github.com/IsaacBell/Unity-Time-Reversal) or [Python](https://github.com/IsaacBell/Computer-Vision-Demo).

Currently involved in the competitive programming scene, and participating in contests where I am able.

  I love programming, I study algorithms every day, and I can talk your ear off about data structures.
  
  I'm also a musician. I also (pseudonymously) write horror novels... okay, well, just one novel so far, but I'm proud of it! There are some [excerpts](https://github.com/IsaacBell/j-78) scattered [around](https://github.com/IsaacBell/crystal-dreams) on my Github profile.
